# Students Performance Predection using differnet Machine Learning Algorithms 

This is a Python code that performs several data analysis tasks on a dataset called "StudentsPerformance.csv". Here is what the code does:

# Import  libraries

 Import necessary libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, etc

# Load Data set 

 Load the dataset "StudentsPerformance.csv" into a pandas dataframe and perform some basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) such as showing the first few rows of the dataframe and plotting boxplots and barplots to visualize the data.
 
# Encode

Encode the categorical variables in the dataset using LabelEncoder and OneHotEncoder methods.

# Train and test Split

Split the data into training and testing sets for machine learning modeling purposes.

Train and test a logistic regression model to predict whether a student completed a test preparation course or not.

Train and test a random forest model and an AdaBoost model to predict the same variable.

# PCA

Use PCA to perform feature reduction and cross-validation to evaluate the performance of different models with different feature subsets.

this code provides a comprehensive example of how to perform data analysis and machine learning modeling using Python libraries.
